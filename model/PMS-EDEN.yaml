#  PMS-EDEN — PAPER-SPECIFIC APPLICATION PROFILE (OVERLAY)
#
#  Repository:
#    https://github.com/tz-dev/PMS-EDEN
#
#  File:
#    PMS-EDEN.yaml
#
#  Profile Version:
#    PMS-EDEN_1.0
#
#  Last Updated:
#    2026-01-08
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  PURPOSE AND STATUS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  This document defines a paper-specific APPLICATION PROFILE for the
#  Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS).
#
#  It operationalizes the structural arguments of the accompanying paper
#
#    “PMS-EDEN — Structural Drift from Praxis to Comparison,
#     Pseudo-Symmetry, and Reciprocity Loss”
#
#  in a machine-readable, operator-constrained form.
#
#  PMS-EDEN is an OVERLAY, not a fork, extension, or reinterpretation of PMS.
#  It remains strictly subordinate to the canonical PMS specification.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  RELATIONSHIP TO PMS (NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  - This profile DEPENDS on the canonical PMS base specification
#    (schema_version: PMS_1.1).
#
#  - It does NOT redefine, replace, reinterpret, or extend the eleven PMS
#    meta-axioms (Δ–Ψ).
#
#  - It does NOT introduce new operators, meta-axioms, or dependency relations.
#
#  - It does NOT modify canonical operator order, dependency hygiene,
#    or derived axes (A, C, R, E, D).
#
#  - All references to operators (Δ–Ψ) retain their meanings exactly as defined
#    in PMS.yaml.
#
#  - Composite labels used in this profile (e.g. NRK, PS, PFO, regimes)
#    are PAPER-INTERNAL DESCRIPTORS, not PMS operators.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  SCOPE OF THE OVERLAY
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  This application profile introduces ONLY overlay-level constructs, including:
#
#    - drift sequences and drift corridors (Eden → NRK → comparison → PS → loss),
#    - regime descriptions (operator-defined, non-ideological),
#    - reduced operator signatures (shorthand for analysis, not axioms),
#    - cost markers and viability boundaries,
#    - EDEN-MAP (scene-bound mapping protocol),
#    - example-suite schemas (non-instructional, non-diagnostic).
#
#  These constructs:
#    - amplify existing PMS operators,
#    - never replace generativity with explanation,
#    - never bypass asymmetry (Ω), temporality (Θ), or distance (Χ),
#    - remain descriptive, non-psychological, and non-prescriptive.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  VALIDITY GATE — PMS ENTRY CONDITION (APPLICATION-ONLY)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Any USE of this profile as a PMS APPLICATION presupposes acceptance of the
#  canonical PMS entry condition:
#
#    - Χ (Distance):
#        maintained reflective distance and stop-capability.
#
#    - Reversibility:
#        all mappings are scene-bound, revisable, and non-totalizing.
#
#    - D (Dignity-in-Practice):
#        no shaming, ranking, humiliation, or ontological person evaluation;
#        critique applies only to enacted structures and cost handling.
#
#  This gate constrains APPLICATION only.
#  PMS itself may be criticized, rejected, or ignored without satisfying it.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  SELF-BINDING AND MODEL HYGIENE
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  In line with PMS.yaml, any application that suspends Distance (Χ),
#  Dignity-in-Practice (D), or Self-Binding discipline (Ψ) in order to enforce
#  truth, authority, or asymmetry is formally INVALID as PMS application,
#  even if PMS terminology is retained.
#
#  PMS-EDEN analyses are therefore:
#    - scene-bound,
#    - structurally revisable,
#    - non-clinical,
#    - non-diagnostic,
#    - non-moralizing.

    is_operator: false
    type: "scene_configuration"
    basis_operators: ["Δ", "∇", "□", "Λ", "Α", "Ω", "Θ", "Φ", "Χ", "Σ", "Ψ"]
    basis_axes: ["A"] # A = Awareness (named once)
    ref: "PMS-EDEN §2"
    definition: >
      Eden is a structurally complete, stable praxis scene without deficit pressure:
      Δ is present (salient distinctions, incl. sexed attributes as differences, not valuations);
      □ is stable (coherent praxis context without scarcity compulsion) constraining ∇ without
      optimization-by-need; Θ is present as continuity/trajectory but not yet as punitive or
      remainder-driven accumulation; A is sustainably available as operator availability
      A = [Θ, □, Δ] (maturity = A-availability, non-psychological); ∇ exists without deficit-compulsion
      dominance; Ω is latent/non-escalated (possible gradients not yet conflict-dominant or
      comparison-coded in □); Λ is not the central engine (no governing remainder/withholding
      structure). Therefore: praxis completeness without tragedy-pressure, but not without maturity.

  THRESHOLD_apple:
    name: "Threshold marker (Apple) — option explicitness"
    is_operator: false
    type: "threshold_marker"
    basis_operators: ["Δ", "□", "Θ"]
    basis_axes: ["A"] # A = Awareness (named once)
    ref: "PMS-EDEN §2.3"
    definition: >
      The apple is a threshold of explicitness (option visibility): a negative praxis option
      (breach) becomes explicitly selectable within □ across Θ under available A = [Θ, □, Δ].
      “Explicitness / possibility space” denotes option-visibility generated by Δ within □ across Θ
      and is not equivalent to Χ and not treated as knowledge/insight. The apple does not add
      Δ, A, or Χ; it marks legibility of an already-possible option, preserving: knowledge ≠ sin,
      sin ≠ knowledge.

  BREACH_chain_interruption:
    name: "Praxis breach as chain interruption (paper lens)"
    is_operator: false
    type: "chain_interrupt"
    basis_operators: ["Δ", "∇", "□", "Ω", "Θ"]
    ref: "PMS-EDEN §3"
    definition: >
      The breach (“sin” as historical alias) is a conscious praxis breach under available A:
      willful realization of a mis-enactment option within □ despite A = [Θ, □, Δ] (alternatives and
      consequential possibility are legible). It is not an epistemic event and generates no new
      operator, no new Δ, and no A-upgrade. Structurally it is enactment/realization under ∇ within
      □ that fails the PMS action criterion E = [Σ, Θ, ∇] because Σ does not carry integration and Ψ
      does not carry durable binding (Ψ absent/failed/externalized/simulated; Χ may be absent/weak).
      What is produced is a consequence field: Ω becomes directionally salient, Θ becomes a carrier of
      irreversibility/accumulation, and Λ appears as structured remainder (“teaches nothing” = no
      epistemic surplus, only irreversible consequences).

  FIG_LEAVES_legibility_management:
    name: "Fig leaves as legibility management"
    is_operator: false
    type: "cost_management_response"
    basis_operators: ["Λ", "Ω", "Χ", "□", "Θ"]
    ref: "PMS-EDEN §4"
    definition: >
      Fig leaves mark a post-breach operator reconfiguration (text-as-praxis), not epistemic awakening
      and not a psychology/shame postulate. No new Δ/□/A appears; what becomes new is consequence
      legibility and irreversibility: Λ becomes an active remainder (non-returnable absence / non-closure),
      Ω becomes instrumentally legible (differences become potential leverage surfaces), and Θ becomes
      trajectory-bearing (non-resettable development). The enacted covering indicates (i) a □ shift toward
      vulnerability/comparison exposure framing, (ii) reactive Χ as shielding distance (exposure attenuation,
      not truth-criterion; not Σ-enabled reflection), and (iii) seeding of Α as a repeatable concealment script.
      Net function: legibility reduction under the Ω/Θ/Λ consequence field, substituting management for
      integration until Σ/Ψ are re-established.
      # A = Awareness named in abbrev_legend; Χ/Σ/Ψ already canonical; "reactive Χ" ≠ knowledge.

  NRK:
    name: "Negative Responsibility Kernel (NRK)"
    is_operator: false
    type: "composite_kernel"
    basis_operators: ["∇", "□", "Ω", "Θ", "Σ", "Ψ"]
    basis_axes: ["R", "E"] # R = Responsibility, E = Action/Enactment (named once)
    ref: "PMS-EDEN §5; Glossary 16.20"
    definition: >
      NRK is a paper-internal composite (not a PMS operator) naming a negative praxis form:
      enactment/realization under ∇ within □ where A = [Θ, □, Δ] is structurally available and a real
      option-set exists, while Σ does not carry integration and Ψ does not carry durable binding
      (Ψ absent/aborted/externalized/simulated). Ω is structurally effective as consequence surface and Θ is
      trajectory-bearing, so the enactment converts a legible option into a non-resettable consequence
      trajectory. NRK preserves PMS discipline by not labeling the breach as E, since E = [Σ, Θ, ∇] requires
      Σ-carrying integration. Χ may be absent or may appear only as defensive shielding; NRK requires only
      that Σ/Ψ do not carry.
      # R = Responsibility, E = Action/Enactment named in abbrev_legend; A = Awareness named there too.

    compact_form: >
      NRK = (A available: [Θ, □, Δ]) + (Ω effective) + (Θ trajectory-bearing) + (real option-set in □) +
      (realization under ∇ within □) with (Σ not carrying) and (Ψ not established / aborted / externalized /
      simulated).
      # Compact, machine-parseable; keeps A/R/E discipline.

    discipline_E_separation: >
      Do not label NRK as E. Treat as realization/enactment under ∇ within □ lacking Σ-carrying integration
      and Ψ-carrying binding; E remains reserved for integrated action (E = [Σ, Θ, ∇]).
      # E = Action/Enactment named once in abbrev_legend.

  FALSE_COMPARISON:
    name: "False comparison pivot"
    is_operator: false
    type: "frame_mutation"
    basis_operators: ["□", "Ω", "Δ", "Λ", "Α", "Θ"]
    ref: "PMS-EDEN §6"
    definition: >
      False comparison is the post-NRK frame inversion in which □ shifts from praxis-relation
      (coordination/interface logic) to value-relation (ranking/standing logic) within an Ω/Θ consequence
      field. Δ remains unchanged operatorially but is used as comparative tokenization; Ω is re-read as
      verdict/grievance surface rather than a coordinate-able gradient; Σ/Ψ cannot carry reciprocity, so
      comparison becomes the substitute stabilizer. Α seeds scanning/positioning scripts and Λ pressure
      tends to accumulate as non-closure under Θ. Net effect: comparison replaces coordination
      (Σ/Ψ carriage), making reciprocity structurally non-viable over time under active Ω and Θ.
      # Δ/□/Ω/Θ are canonical; "comparison" is a □-use drift, not a new operator.

  DISSATISFACTION_system_cost:
    name: "Dissatisfaction as system cost marker"
    is_operator: false
    type: "cost_marker"
    basis_operators: ["□", "Ω", "Θ", "Α", "Λ"]
    ref: "PMS-EDEN §7"
    definition: >
      Dissatisfaction is modeled as the *expected system cost* of maintaining a false equivalence
      (equivalence-as-value-relation) inside □ under effective Ω and trajectory-bearing Θ, not as deficit
      or lack. Mechanism: Δ persists in outcomes; □ enforces equivalence, so the system must run continuous
      comparison + correction + justification across Θ. Φ typically supplies recurring narrative repair,
      Α stabilizes the loop as a script, Λ accumulates as non-closure residue when mismatches cannot be
      integrated. Net: “continuous comparison/adjustment/dissatisfaction” is the surface of a
      frame-mismatch under real gradients, especially where Σ/Ψ do not carry coordination.
      # Φ/Σ/Ψ mentioned here as companions/absences (canonical operators); not added as basis_operators.

  PS:
    name: "Pseudo-Symmetry (PS) regime"
    is_operator: false
    type: "drift_regime"
    basis_operators: ["□", "Ω", "Σ", "Ψ"]
    ref: "PMS-EDEN §9; Glossary 16.11"
    definition: >
      Pseudo-Symmetry (PS) is a drift regime in which rhetorical equality is asserted within □ while real
      Ω gradients continue to operate in consequences. Ω is denied/tabooed as functional gradient-speech,
      option-space is flattened (Δ is re-described as “the same”), Σ is bypassed (integration replaced by
      narrative equivalence via Φ), and Ψ binds to appearance-management (maintaining parity-appearance)
      rather than binding to coordination interfaces matching real Ω across Θ. PS is structurally viable
      only as reversible buffer; as persistent substitution (Φ/Λ/Α companions), it yields Σ/Ψ failure under Ω.
      # PS = Pseudo-Symmetry named at first mention; Σ = Integration, Ψ = Self-Binding already canonical.

    core_operator_signature_9_1: >
      PS = [□ (comparison/value-relation), Ω (real gradient), Σ (low/blocked), Ψ (misbound to appearance-management)].
      # Brackets denote component set (co-configuration), not arithmetic.

    typical_companions_9_1: >
      Typical companions: Φ (recontextualization as repair surface), Λ (non-event residue/non-closure),
      Α (attractor/protocol lock). These are companions, not additions to the PS basis signature.
      # Φ = Recontextualization, Λ = Non-Event, Α = Attractor (named at first mention here).

  PFO:
    name: "Postfeminist Override / Over-steering (PFO)"
    is_operator: false
    type: "meta_frame_regime"
    basis_operators: ["□", "Ω", "Φ", "Λ", "Α", "Σ", "Ψ", "Θ"]
    ref: "PMS-EDEN §10; Glossary 16.12"
    definition: >
      Postfeminist Override / Over-steering (PFO) is a regime-level meta-frame: □ is configured as
      (comparison metric + Ω-taboo), so functional Ω coordination is disallowed while Ω remains operative.
      Stabilization shifts to high Φ (continuous narrative repair), persistent Λ (open remainder as standing
      constraint/control surface), and Α protocolization (repeatable scripts), with Σ suppressed and Ψ
      displaced/misbound (binding to appearance-management instead of explicit coordination). Under Θ,
      this produces repeatable drift (short-term de-escalation, long-term reciprocity erosion) without
      requiring ideology claims (purely operator-behavioral regime hypothesis).
      # PFO = Postfeminist Override named at first mention; Θ = Temporality named here as trajectory carrier.

    operator_form_regime_definition_10_1: >
      PFO = □(Ω-taboo + comparison) + Φ-high + Λ-open + Α-protocol with Σ suppressed and Ψ displaced/misbound
      across Θ (trajectory-bearing costs/erosion).
      # Compact regime form; “+” here is descriptive concatenation (not axis algebra), not operator redefinition.

    positioning_in_master_trace_10_0: >
      Master-trace placement: Eden/Threshold → NRK → comparison-dominant □ → PS → (devaluation/humiliation protocols)
      → reciprocity loss; PFO functions as meta-frame that makes the sequence repeatable by stabilizing Ω-illegibility
      and substituting Φ/Λ/Α for Σ/Ψ consolidation under Θ.
      # Links regime role to pipeline; no new operators introduced.

  RECIPROCITY:
    name: "Reciprocity (structural definition; not symmetry)"
    is_operator: false
    type: "coordination_structure"
    basis_operators: ["Ω", "Σ", "Ψ", "Θ", "Χ"]
    basis_axes: ["D"] # D = Dignity-in-practice (constraint on Ω-handling) — named here once
    ref: "PMS-EDEN Glossary 16.21"
    definition: >
      Reciprocity is not symmetry; it is coordinated asymmetry. Form: Σ (Integration) operates under real
      Ω (Asymmetry) and is stabilized across Θ (Temporality) by Ψ (Self-Binding), while Χ (Distance) limits
      escalation and preserves reversibility; D (Dignity-in-practice) constrains Ω-handling as
      D = (Ψ ∘ Χ) applied to Ω-handling. Minimal condition: Ω legible (as functional gradient) + Σ active
      (interface synthesis) + Ψ anchored (durable commitment to coordination, not appearance) + Χ present
      (inhibition/meta-position). If any component collapses, reciprocity becomes unstable, simulated, or
      displaced into substitutes (Φ/Λ/Α, devaluation, protocol control).
      # Ω=Asymmetry, Σ=Integration, Ψ=Self-Binding, Θ=Temporality, Χ=Distance named here at first mention.

  RECIPROCITY_LOSS:
    name: "Loss of reciprocity"

    type: "erosion_trajectory"
    basis_operators: ["Ω", "Θ", "Λ", "Α", "Σ", "Ψ"]
    ref: "PMS-EDEN §11"
    definition: >
      Loss of reciprocity is a trajectory of channel erosion under Θ once Ω is real but denied/tabooed in □,
      such that Σ cannot consolidate and Ψ is displaced (absent/externalized/misbound). Λ becomes chronic
      remainder (non-closure persists and accumulates), and Α stabilizes repeatable scripts (indirect control,
      avoidance, status regulation) that substitute for coordinated interfaces. Net: stability is maintained
      via management/substitution rather than Σ/Ψ-carried coordination, yielding cumulative erosion across Θ.
      # Λ=Non-Event, Α=Attractor named here once; □/Φ referenced as companions, not added to basis_operators.

  DEVALUATION:
    name: "Devaluation"
    is_operator: false
    type: "stabilization_substitute"
    basis_operators: ["□", "Ω", "Λ", "Α", "Θ"]
    ref: "PMS-EDEN Glossary 16.22"
    definition: >
      Devaluation is a stabilization substitute in which □ (Frame) uses Ω-relevant differences/exposures as
      standing signals and reduces the other’s standing-in-practice to lower conflict salience or regain control.
      It typically operates by keeping Λ (Non-Event) open (unresolved residue as implicit debt/leverage) and
      stabilizing the move as Α (Attractor) script across Θ (Temporality). Devaluation substitutes status
      operations for Σ/Ψ-based coordination when integration/binding are blocked or punished in the dominant □.
      # □=Frame named here at first mention; ties to Σ/Ψ are explanatory companions only.

  HUMILIATION:
    name: "Humiliation (paper-internal structural use)"
    is_operator: false
    type: "cost_marker"
    basis_operators: ["Ω", "□", "Θ", "Λ"]
    ref: "PMS-EDEN Glossary 16.13"
    definition: >
      Humiliation (paper-internal) denotes status regulation via devaluation as residual stabilization when
      Ω gradients are action-relevant but functional Ω-coordination is blocked in □ and reciprocity carriers
      (Σ integration / Ψ self-binding) do not consolidate. Structurally, it marks a cost mode: short-term
      stability is purchased by standing reduction and persistent remainder (Λ) rather than by coordinated
      interface repair across Θ. This is a structural descriptor (no motive/trait claim; no moral verdict).

# EDEN-MAP (Method appendix) — operational schema placeholders (machine-useful)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
eden_map:
  note: "EDEN-MAP is a scene-bound mapping protocol; not diagnostic; respects validity_gate."
  ref: "PMS-EDEN §15"

  purpose_and_validity_window_15_1: |
    EDEN-MAP is a structural mapping protocol for PMS–EDEN analyses: it maps Δ–Ψ operator constellations in bounded scenes without diagnosing persons.
    Mapping may remain purely descriptive. The moment it is used to prescribe/bind/obligate/demand, PMS application validity requires Χ (distance) + reversibility + D (dignity-in-practice constraints on Ω-handling); bypassing these is formally invalid as PMS application.
    EDEN-MAP provides questions and templates only; it does not authorize sanctions, coercion, or “use against” roles/persons. Repeated mappings that show persistent cost externalization across scenes indicate structural non-viability unless costs are re-internalized; chronic one-sided cost bearing across Θ is a drift-regime indicator.

  minimal_unit_scene_packet_15_2:
    note: "Schema for minimal analysis unit (Scene Packet)."
    schema: |
      Scene Packet = bounded record of operator-relevant elements (scene-bound; role-based; non-diagnostic).

      SceneID = {Θwindow: <time-span>, □anchor: <context/frame anchor>, roles: <role-positions present>}
      Trigger = {Δ: <activating distinction>, ∇: <activated tension/impulse>}
      Λcandidates = [<what was expected but absent / non-closures created under □>]
      Realizations = {observed: <enactments>, omissions: <not-done>, escalations: <escalation moves>}
      Echeck = {E_present?: yes|no|partial, Σcarrier?: yes|no|partial, notes: <why realization ≠ E if Σ not carrying>}
      Αstabilizers = [<repeatable scripts/protocols visible>]
      Ωreal = {capacity: <gradient>, exposure: <gradient>, obligation: <gradient>, leverage: <gradient>}
      Ψmap = {declared: <claimed commitments>, enacted: <carried across Θ>, enforced: <how maintained>, externalized: <Ψ→Other demands>}

      Discipline: realization/enactment ≠ E unless Σ carries the act; binding outsourced as Ψ→Other is recorded explicitly (not treated as integration).

  core_questions_required_15_3: |
    EDEN-MAP requires Q1–Q6 in order, producing explicit operator statements:

    Q1 (□): Which frame dominates (or hybrid), and what it permits/forbids as relevant/speakable/punishable?
      Output: □dominant = <praxis|comparison|moral|scarcity|security|narrative|hybrid> + 1–2 sentences.

    Q2 (Ω): What asymmetry is real in consequences (capacity/exposure/obligation/leverage), and is Ω legible or taboo inside □?
      Output: Ωreal = {capacity: …, exposure: …, obligation: …, leverage: …} + Ω-legible? yes/no.

    Q3 (Λ): Which non-event/non-closure is active, how is it handled (denial/minimization/moralization/displacement/pseudo-closure), and what persists across Θ?
      Output: Λactive = …; Λhandling = …; Λremainder = ….

    Q4 (Χ): Where is distance missing/punished (no attenuation/revision windows) and where is it instrumentalized as control (erasure/leverage protection)?
      Output: Χabsent = …; Χinstrumental = …; Χrestoration = <minimal reversible step consistent with D>.

    Q5 (Σ): Where is integration low/failed/suppressed/simulated, what blocks it (□/Ω/Λ/Θ), and what is the minimal interface move that would count as Σ?
      Output: Σstatus = …; Σblockers = {□: …, Ω: …, Λ: …, Θ: …}; Σminimum = ….

    Q6 (Ψ): Who self-binds (Ψ→Self), who externalizes binding (Ψ→Other demands), and how is binding enforced (self-restraint vs frame/leverage coercion)?
      Output: Ψself = …; Ψexternal = …; Ψrepair = <shift toward self-control preserving reversibility and D>.

  synthesis_output_one_page_15_4: |
    One-page synthesis is operator-readable, non-diagnostic:

    Drift = □dominant → Λhandling → Αstabilizer → Ωmanagement → Σstatus → Ψpattern
    Αprimary = <the repeatable script that keeps the configuration stable>
    Costs = {A: …, C: …, R: …, E: …, D: …}
      A-costs: monitoring/option-visibility load under Θ/□/Δ
      C-costs: coherence volatility vs stabilization under Θ/Λ/□/∇
      R-costs: responsibility clarity vs outsourcing under Ψ/Φ/Θ/Ω
      E-costs: integrated enactment bandwidth vs suppression (E requires Σ-carriage)
      D-costs: restraint/protection load vs degradation risk ((Ψ∘Χ) applied to Ω-handling)

    LowestCostCorrection (descriptive viability signature; not a prescription):
      {Χstep: <restore reversible distance without erasing Ω>,
       Λ→Σstep: <convert one Λ remainder into one Σ interface move>,
       Ψshift: <move from Ψ→Other to Ψ→Self, preserving reversibility and D>}

  diagnostics_to_action_firewall_15_5: |
    Mandatory guardrail: EDEN-MAP is not a person-evaluation tool.
    Allowed: scene-bound structural mapping (roles/frames/non-events/binding), drift-risk and cost geometry, reversible dignity-preserving viability signatures (Χ + reversibility + D).
    Not allowed: global person labels, inferred inner traits/states/clinical categories, coercive prescriptions justified by PMS vocabulary (Ψ→Other) under suppressed Χ.

  meta_notes_operational_constraints_15_6: |
    Operational constraints:
    - Clarity ≠ humiliation: operator naming can be precise without degrading standing (D remains an application constraint).
    - Naming ≠ moralizing: Ω/Λ/□ can be specified functionally without verdict logic.
    - Firmness ≠ dignity break: boundaries can be enacted with Χ and reversibility; hardness becomes dignity-violating only when D is suspended.

glossary_index:
  note: "Verbatim glossary entries live in paper; here: stable handles/refs only."
  ref: "PMS-EDEN §16"
  entries:
    "16.1_A": |
      Awareness (A) — structural availability of sustained, framed differentiation across time.
      Handle: A = [Θ, □, Δ]. Non-psychological: operator availability, not inner state.
      Crosslinks: §0.5–0.6 (ACRED defs), §2 (Eden ground state), §3 (breach “teaches nothing”), §12 (truth vs application).
    "16.7_E": |
      Action (E) vs enactment/realization — hard discipline boundary.
      Handle: E = [Σ, Θ, ∇]. Realization/enactment is a neutral observable; it is not E unless Σ carries integration.
      Crosslinks: §3 (chain interruption), §5 (NRK not-E), §15.2 (Scene Packet Echeck).
    "16.11_PS": |
      Pseudo-Symmetry (PS) — rhetorical parity inside comparison-dominant □ under real Ω.
      Handle: PS = parity-claim + Ω persists + Σ bypassed/simulated + Ψ misbound to appearance-management; often Φ/Λ/Α as stabilizers.
      Crosslinks: §9 (PS regime), §7 (false equivalence compulsion), §6 (false comparison pivot).
    "16.12_PFO": |
      Postfeminist Override (PFO) — regime/meta-frame hypothesis defined by operator behavior (non-ideological).
      Handle: □ enforces Ω-illegibility/taboo + Φ high + Λ retained + Σ suppressed + Ψ displaced/misbound; stabilizes via Α protocolization.
      Crosslinks: §10 (PFO as regime), §12 (application gate), §15 (firewall).
    "16.13_HUMILIATION": |
      Humiliation — paper-internal structural term: status regulation via devaluation as residual stabilization when Σ/Ψ coordination under named Ω is blocked.
      Handle: humiliation = devaluation-script stabilization (Α) inside comparison/value □ under Ω-taboo, often using Λ as standing remainder.
      Crosslinks: §10.3 (residual mode), §11.3.3 (stability via devaluation), §16.22 (devaluation).
    "16.20_NRK": |
      Negative Responsibility Kernel (NRK) — paper-internal composite/pattern label (not a PMS operator).
      Handle: enactment under ∇ within □ while A=[Θ,□,Δ] is available and options exist, with Σ not carrying and/or Ψ absent/aborted/externalized/simulated; Ω effective; Θ trajectory-bearing.
      Crosslinks: §5 (formal NRK), §3 (breach profile), §4 (legibility management), §15 (Scene Packet triggers).
    "16.21_RECIPROCITY": |
      Reciprocity — coordinated asymmetry, not symmetry.
      Handle: reciprocity = Σ under real Ω, bound by Ψ across Θ, limited by Χ (and constrained by D in application).
      Crosslinks: §11 (reciprocity loss), §12 (binding validity), §0.6 (R/D axes).
    "16.22_DEVALUATION": |
      Devaluation — paper-internal label for lowering standing-in-practice as a control move substituting for coordination when Σ/Ψ cannot consolidate under named Ω.
      Handle: devaluation operates inside □ (often □comparison/□moral), commonly stabilized via Α and maintained via Λ residues.
      Crosslinks: §9 (PS drift), §10 (PFO residual stabilization), §11 (channel erosion), §16.13 (humiliation).
    "16.25_COST_MARKER": |
      Structural Drift Cost Marker — paper-wide warning handle for drift regimes sustained by cost externalization.
      Handle: recurrent pattern where integration/binding work is displaced (Σ low/simulated, Ψ→Other externalized or Ψ misbound), Ω-legibility suppressed, Λ retained, Α protocolized, costs accumulate under Θ.
      Crosslinks: closure cost markers in §3–§12, EDEN-MAP §15.1 (mapping-level cost marker), PMS-EDEN 16.25 (authoritative marker).
