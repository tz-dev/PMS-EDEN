# PMS–EDEN

**Structural Drift from Praxis to Comparison, Pseudo-Symmetry, and Reciprocity Loss**

**PMS–EDEN is a formal application of the [Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS)](https://github.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory)** — a generative operator framework (Δ–Ψ) for modelling praxis, asymmetry, temporality, and self-binding.

While PMS provides the **canonical operator grammar** for analysing action and non-action, PMS–EDEN reconstructs a widely moralized story as a **strictly structural drift trace**: how a praxis-ordered configuration collapses into comparison, how asymmetry becomes status-legible, and why pseudo-symmetry can stabilize short-term while dissolving reciprocity long-term.

Building explicitly on PMS as its structural foundation, this project does **not modify or extend the PMS operator set**, but uses it **strictly as specified** to show:

* why “loss of Eden” is not an epistemic event but a **praxis breach under available awareness (A)**,
* how a **comparison-dominant frame (□)** turns difference (Δ) and asymmetry (Ω) into ranking tokens,
* why false equivalence yields compulsive monitoring (continuous comparison, continuous correction, and chronic dissatisfaction
* how **Pseudo-Symmetry (PS)** stabilizes drift by substituting **Φ/Λ/Α** for **Σ/Ψ** under real **Ω**,
* and how reciprocity collapses as **coordinated asymmetry** fails under **Θ**-extended residue fields (Λ).

In this sense, PMS–EDEN should be read as:

* **conceptually dependent on PMS**,
* **formally consistent with the PMS operator grammar**, and
* **focused on the structural discipline of drift legibility and non-coercive analysis**.

## What PMS–EDEN Is

PMS–EDEN is:

* A **structural theory of drift** (not a moral doctrine)
* A **PMS-conform application** of the operator grammar (Δ–Ψ)
* A framework for analysing:
  * **frame drift (□)** from praxis-relation to value-relation
  * **asymmetry legibility (Ω)** and its conversion into status signals
  * **non-event residue (Λ)** as chronic remainder / leverage surface
  * the stabilizing roles (and misuse risks) of **Φ**, **Α**
  * the failure modes of **integration (Σ)** and **self-binding (Ψ)** under **Θ**
* A viability model that evaluates drift by:
  * **operator carriage** (what carries coordination vs what substitutes for it)
  * **reversibility and restraint** (Χ / D constraints when applied)
  * **structural costs** (comparison load, residue accumulation, reciprocity decay)
  * rather than moral “who is right”

**Guiding formula:**

> **Non-moral in description /  
> Criterial in operator carriage /  
> Guardrailed in application**

---

## What PMS–EDEN Is *Not*

PMS–EDEN is not:

* A theology, sermon, or moral ranking system
* A psychological theory of traits, motives, or diagnoses
* A couple-therapy method or advice manual
* A framework for person-evaluation, blame allocation, or sanctioning
* A justification tool for coercion, humiliation, or irreversible binding demands

PMS–EDEN treats “Eden” as a **praxeological configuration** —  
not as a virtue state, innocence claim, or metaphysical anthropology.

---

## Core Thesis

PMS–EDEN argues that:

* The decisive shift is not “knowledge,” but a **praxis breach** under available **A = [Θ, □, Δ]** with failed **Σ/Ψ** carriage.
* Post-breach, **Ω (asymmetry)** becomes consequence-legible under **Θ**, and **□** tends to drift into a **value-relation** (comparison/ranking).
* Treating structurally different configurations (Δ) as equivalent inside a comparison frame forces a **compulsion loop**:
  * permanent comparison,
  * permanent correction,
  * permanent dissatisfaction — as *system cost*, not deficit.
* **Pseudo-Symmetry (PS)** is a stable substitution regime:
  * rhetorical parity inside **□comparison** under real **Ω**,
  * **Φ/Λ/Α** substitute for **Σ/Ψ**,
  * reciprocity decays as coordinated asymmetry cannot consolidate.

> Eden is not “lost by insight” —  
> it is lost when coordination (Σ) and binding (Ψ) fail under legible consequence trajectories (Θ).

---

## Relation to PMS

PMS–EDEN is built directly on the **canonical PMS operator grammar (Δ–Ψ)** as defined in [`PMS.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory/refs/heads/main/model/PMS.yaml) (schema_version: `PMS_1.1`).

* No new operators are introduced
* No operator is redefined
* All dependency rules are respected
* Eden, breach, and drift are analysed strictly as **operator configurations** and **derived-axis consequences**

Where PMS provides the **structural grammar of praxis**,  
PMS–EDEN shows what follows when that grammar is applied to:

* differentiation without ranking (Δ under □praxis),
* consequence-legibility under irreversibility (Ω/Θ),
* non-event residue fields (Λ),
* pseudo-symmetry as stabilization substitute (PS),
* and reciprocity loss as channel erosion under time (Θ).

## Structural Contributions

### 1. Eden as a Praxis Frame (Δ without Ranking)

Eden is modelled as a mature configuration where:

* **Δ (difference)** is structurally available,
* **□ (frame)** remains praxis-oriented (coordination-first),
* **Θ (temporality)** does not yet force consequence cascades into status accounting.

Distinction is functional — not comparative.

### 2. The Breach as Operator-Carriage Failure (Σ/Ψ)

The breach is defined structurally:

* **A = [Θ, □, Δ]** is available (options are visible),
* but **Σ (integration)** and/or **Ψ (self-binding)** do not carry enactment,
* yielding an irreversible consequence field under **Θ**.

### 3. False Equivalence as Compulsion Engine

Once **□** becomes comparison-dominant, flattening Δ into equivalence produces:

* continuous observation (Dauervergleich),
* continuous correction (Dauerjustierung),
* continuous dissatisfaction (Dauerunzufriedenheit),

as a **maintenance cost** of sustaining equivalence under legible **Ω** and accumulating **Θ**.

### 4. Pseudo-Symmetry (PS) as Drift Stabilizer

PS is formalized as rhetorical parity under real **Ω**, where:

* **Ω** becomes taboo as a coordination object,
* **Σ** is replaced by **Φ** (narrative repair substitutes interface change),
* **Ψ** binds to appearance-management,
* **Λ** remains open as remainder/leverage,
* **Α** locks the protocol into repeatable scripts.

### 5. Reciprocity Loss as Channel Erosion (Tragedy, not Guilt)

Reciprocity is defined as:

* **Σ under real Ω, bound by Ψ, limited by Χ**,

and its loss is modelled as predictable erosion when:

* **□comparison** dominates,
* **Ω** is taboo/weaponized,
* **Λ** becomes chronic,
* **Α** stabilizes indirect control and devaluation substitutes.

## Intended Use

PMS–EDEN is intended for:

* Structural theorists modelling drift from coordination to comparison
* Analysts studying asymmetry, residues, and non-closure fields (Ω/Λ/Θ)
* Governance and accountability designers working under irreversibility
* Readers who want a **non-moral, non-clinical** vocabulary for regime-like relationship drift

It is **not** intended for coercive application, person-ranking, or prescriptive enforcement.
Any use as guidance must respect the paper’s application gate (Χ + reversibility + D).

## Final Note

PMS–EDEN does not tell you who is guilty.

It explains how drift becomes structurally stable when:

* comparison captures the frame (□),
* asymmetry becomes status-legible (Ω),
* residues stay open (Λ),
* scripts repeat (Α),
* and coordination/binding (Σ/Ψ) are replaced by substitutes.

> Eden is not repaired by verdicts —
> it is repaired (if at all) by re-opening coordination under real asymmetry.
