# PMS–EDEN

## Structural Drift from Praxis to Comparison, Pseudo-Symmetry, and Reciprocity Loss

**PMS–EDEN is a formal application of the [Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS)](https://github.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory)** — a generative operator framework (Δ–Ψ) for modelling praxis, asymmetry, temporality, distance, integration, and self-binding.

While PMS provides the **canonical operator grammar** for analysing action and non-action, PMS–EDEN reconstructs a widely moralized story as a **strictly structural drift trace**: how a praxis-ordered configuration collapses into comparison, how asymmetry becomes status-legible, and why pseudo-symmetry can stabilize short-term while dissolving reciprocity long-term.

Building explicitly on PMS as its structural foundation, this project does **not modify or extend the PMS operator set**, but uses it **strictly as specified** to show:

* why “loss of Eden” is not an epistemic event but a **praxis breach under available awareness (A)**,
* how a **comparison-dominant frame (□)** turns difference (Δ) and asymmetry (Ω) into ranking tokens,
* why false equivalence yields compulsive monitoring (continuous comparison, continuous correction, and chronic dissatisfaction),
* how **Pseudo-Symmetry (PS)** stabilizes drift by substituting **Φ / Λ / Α** for **Σ / Ψ** under real **Ω**,
* and how reciprocity collapses as **coordinated asymmetry** fails under **Θ**-extended residue fields (Λ).

In this sense, PMS–EDEN should be read as:

* **conceptually dependent on PMS**,
* **formally consistent with the PMS operator grammar**, and
* **focused on the structural discipline of drift legibility and non-coercive analysis**.

## What PMS–EDEN Is

PMS–EDEN is:

* a **structural theory of drift** (not a moral doctrine),
* a **PMS_1.1–conform application profile** of the operator grammar (Δ–Ψ),
* a framework for analysing:
  * **frame drift (□)** from praxis-relation to value-relation,
  * **asymmetry legibility (Ω)** and its conversion into status signals,
  * **non-event residue (Λ)** as chronic remainder / leverage surface,
  * the stabilizing roles (and misuse risks) of **Φ** and **Α**,
  * the failure modes of **integration (Σ)** and **self-binding (Ψ)** under **Θ**,
* a viability model that evaluates drift by:
  * **operator carriage** (what carries coordination vs. what substitutes for it),
  * **reversibility and restraint** (Χ / D constraints when applied),
  * **structural costs** (comparison load, residue accumulation, reciprocity decay),
  * rather than moral “who is right.”

**Guiding formula:**

> **Non-moral in description /  
> Criterial in operator carriage /  
> Guardrailed in application**

---

## What PMS–EDEN Is *Not*

PMS–EDEN is not:

* a theology, sermon, or moral ranking system,
* a psychological theory of traits, motives, or diagnoses,
* a therapy framework, mediation manual, or advice system,
* a framework for person-evaluation, blame allocation, or sanctioning,
* a justification tool for coercion, humiliation, or irreversible binding demands.

PMS–EDEN treats “Eden” as a **praxeological configuration** —  
not as a virtue state, innocence claim, or metaphysical anthropology.

---

## Core Thesis

PMS–EDEN argues that:

* the decisive shift is not “knowledge,” but a **praxis breach** under available  
  **A = [Θ, □, Δ]** with failed **Σ / Ψ** carriage,
* post-breach, **Ω (asymmetry)** becomes consequence-legible under **Θ**, and **□** tends to drift into a **value-relation** (comparison/ranking),
* treating structurally different configurations (Δ) as equivalent inside a comparison frame forces a **compulsion loop**:
  * permanent comparison,
  * permanent correction,
  * permanent dissatisfaction — as *system cost*, not deficit,
* **Pseudo-Symmetry (PS)** is a stable substitution regime:
  * rhetorical parity inside **□comparison** under real **Ω**,
  * **Φ / Λ / Α** substitute for **Σ / Ψ**,
  * reciprocity decays as coordinated asymmetry cannot consolidate.

> Eden is not “lost by insight” —  
> it is lost when coordination (Σ) and binding (Ψ) fail under legible consequence trajectories (Θ).

---

## Relation to PMS

PMS–EDEN is built directly on the **canonical PMS operator grammar (Δ–Ψ)** as defined in  
[`PMS.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory/refs/heads/main/model/PMS.yaml)  
(schema_version: `PMS_1.1`).

* no new operators are introduced,
* no operator is redefined,
* all dependency rules are respected,
* Eden, breach, and drift are analysed strictly as **operator configurations** and **derived-axis consequences**.

Where PMS provides the **structural grammar of praxis**,  
PMS–EDEN shows what follows when that grammar is applied to:

* differentiation without ranking (Δ under □praxis),
* consequence-legibility under irreversibility (Ω / Θ),
* non-event residue fields (Λ),
* pseudo-symmetry as stabilization substitute (PS),
* and reciprocity loss as channel erosion under time (Θ).

---

## Safety & Formal Guardrails (Mandatory)

PMS–EDEN is valid as a PMS application only under the standard entry condition:

* **Χ (distance) preserved:** analysis maintains meta-position and stop-capability; no fusion with role perspectives.
* **Reversibility preserved:** claims remain scene-bound and revisable; no person labels.
* **D (dignity-in-practice) preserved:** critique avoids shaming; humiliation is never justified as “analysis.”

> If you cannot keep **Χ + reversibility + D**, you cannot claim PMS-valid application.

## What You Can Do With PMS.yaml + PMS–EDEN.yaml  
*(That PMS Alone Does Not Provide)*

PMS.yaml gives you the **canonical operator system** (Δ–Ψ), dependency hygiene, derived structures (incl. D), and the PMS entry condition.

**PMS–EDEN.yaml** adds a **domain-specific application profile** for *structural drift from praxis to comparison* that makes several things explicitly reusable across analyses and tools:

### 1) Master trace (drift corridor)

PMS–EDEN defines a canonical **master trace**:

> **Eden → Threshold → NRK → □comparison dominance → PS → devaluation → reciprocity loss**

This provides a stable orientation spine for locating scenes *without* collapsing into narrative or moral explanation.

### 2) EDEN-MAP (scene-bound mapping protocol)

A strict, question-driven protocol for mapping operator configurations in a scene:

* dominant frame (□),
* real asymmetries (Ω),
* active non-events (Λ),
* attractor stabilization (Α),
* distance failures (Χ),
* integration and binding status (Σ / Ψ).

EDEN-MAP is **descriptive only** and includes a mandatory application firewall.

### 3) Drift catalogue (structural regimes, not labels)

PMS–EDEN formalizes predictable drift signatures, including:

* NRK (praxis breach under available awareness),
* pseudo-symmetry,
* Ω escalation under □comparison,
* Λ as leverage surface,
* Α script fixation,
* reciprocity loss as Σ / Ψ failure under Θ.

These are **configuration statements**, not diagnoses or person-claims.

### 4) Boundary conditions & alternative explanations

The model explicitly specifies when the EDEN pipeline applies weakly or not at all
(e.g. minimal Ω, praxis-dominant □, early Σ / Ψ, institutional scaffolding),
and lists **alternative sufficient generators** to prevent over-claiming.

### 5) Example-suite schema

A strict vignette format for repository examples that enforces:

* scene-boundedness,
* operator mapping,
* cost layout (Ω under Θ),
* limited drift markers,
* explicit validity gate reminder,
* readable structural closure (no advice, no prescriptions).

## PMS–EDEN YAML (Addon Specification) + Model Spec (Human-Readable)

This repository includes **PMS–EDEN.yaml** as a machine-readable application profile.

Additionally, a **model specification bundle** is provided under `model/`, following the same conventions as other PMS application repositories:

* `model/PMS–EDEN.yaml` — canonical addon/profile (machine-readable)
* `model/Model Specification.html` — human-readable technical specification
* `model/Model Specification.pdf` — print-stable specification

**Recommended reading order:**

1. PMS base grammar (`PMS.yaml`)
2. `model/PMS–EDEN.yaml` (overlay: master trace, EDEN-MAP, drift, boundaries)
3. Paper text (*Structural Drift from Praxis to Comparison, Pseudo-Symmetry, and Reciprocity Loss*)
4. Example Suite (structural stress tests)

## Example Suite (Structural Stress Tests)

The `examples/` directory contains five uniform, PMS–EDEN–conform worked cases.
They function as **structural stress tests**, not illustrations or prescriptions.

Each example:

* models a **high-misread-risk situation** (where readers typically moralize or psychologize),
* applies the **same operator discipline** used in the paper,
* separates **roles, costs, frames, and trajectories** from persons or character,
* enforces the **PMS application gate (Χ + reversibility + D)**.

Included cases:

1. **Pseudo-Symmetry under Real Cost Asymmetry**
   *Equality rhetoric as frame substitution under Ω and Θ.*

2. **Mediation Termination vs. Mediation Compulsion**
   *Why ending mediation can be cost-rational rather than a character failure.*

3. **“Teaches Nothing” vs. the Learning / Transgression Myth**
   *Threshold acts as consequence-legibility without epistemic gain.*

4. **Fig Leaves / Legibility Management Without Psychology**
   *Exposure management and script stabilization without shame or guilt models.*

5. **“Who Goes First?” as Trajectory Origin, Not Moral Rank**
   *Sequence effects, origin asymmetry, and irreversibility without blame.*

The Example Suite trains **structural reading discipline**:
how to keep **Λ, Ω, and Θ** visible without collapsing into verdicts.

---

## Intended Use

PMS–EDEN is intended for:

* structural theorists modelling drift from coordination to comparison,
* analysts studying asymmetry, residues, and non-closure fields (Ω / Λ / Θ),
* governance and accountability designers working under irreversibility,
* readers seeking a **non-moral, non-clinical** vocabulary for regime-like relational drift.

It is **not** intended for coercive application, person-ranking, or prescriptive enforcement.

Any use as guidance must respect the **application gate**:
**Χ (distance) + reversibility + D (dignity-in-practice)**.

Contributions, critiques, and structural questions are welcome.
Please open an issue or submit a pull request.

### Contribution scope (structural only)

Especially welcome:

* additional EDEN-MAP examples following the schema,
* clarifications to drift or boundary condition formulations,
* tooling that consumes PMS.yaml + PMS–EDEN.yaml without reimplementing operators,
* documentation improvements that strengthen reversibility and dignity-in-practice.

Out of scope:

* introducing new operators,
* redefining PMS dependencies,
* person-typing, diagnosis, or motive attribution,
* turning drift labels into enforcement or sanction logic,
* instructional or prescriptive content.

## Final Note

PMS–EDEN does not tell you who is guilty.

It explains how drift becomes structurally stable when:

* comparison captures the frame (□),
* asymmetry becomes status-legible (Ω),
* residues stay open (Λ),
* scripts repeat (Α),
* and coordination/binding (Σ / Ψ) are replaced by substitutes.

> Eden is not repaired by verdicts —
> it is repaired, if at all, by reopening coordination under real asymmetry.
