## Example 4: Fig Leaves / Legibility Management Without Psychology

**Case label:** *Shielding, Exposure, and the Birth of Stabilized Scripts*  
**Scope discipline:** Structural description only. No shame/guilt psychology, no interior states, no moral affect attribution. All claims remain at the level of frames, operators, and observable stabilizations. PMS application remains conditional on **Χ + reversibility + D**.

### A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)

**Scene ID:**  
- **Θ (temporality):** Immediate post-breach interval; trajectory already altered, but scripts not yet stabilized.  
- **□ (frame anchor):** Shift from **□praxis** (coordination-first) to **□vulnerability** (exposure-first).  
- **Roles (not persons):**  
  - Role R₁: position newly exposed by consequence-legibility.  
  - Role R₂: position capable of observing, reacting to, or leveraging exposure.

**Trigger (Δ/∇):**  
- **Δ:** A newly salient distinction between “exposed” and “shielded.”  
- **∇:** Directed impulse to reduce exposure immediately (not to explain, justify, or integrate).

**Λ candidates (expected but missing):**  
- Immediate reintegration into prior coordination.  
- A frame where exposure has no relevance.  
- Symmetrical legibility of vulnerability across roles.

**Observed realizations (neutral):**  
- Covering, hiding, or boundary-setting behaviors.  
- Reduction of visibility rather than expansion of coordination.  
- Early repetition of protective moves.

### B. Drift Trace (Operator-Readable)

`Drift = breach → Θ binds exposure → Ω becomes legible → □ shifts to vulnerability → Χ appears as inhibition → Α (protective scripts) → Φ later narrativizes`

**Key transitions:**
- **Ω (asymmetry)** becomes readable as differential exposure.  
- **□ (frame)** pivots to vulnerability management.  
- **Χ (distance)** appears as **protective inhibition**, not reflective pause.  
- **Α (attractor)** begins to stabilize repeatable shielding scripts.

---

### C. Structural Result (What Is Established)

- Exposure becomes a primary relevance criterion.  
- Visibility is treated as costly.  
- Early inhibition patterns acquire stabilizing force.

**Structural claim:**  
The “fig leaf” is not an emotion or confession, but a **frame-compatible shielding operation** that manages exposure under newly legible asymmetry.

---

### D. Cost Distribution (Structural, Not Psychological)

**Cost types:**
- **Immediate costs:** loss of transparency, reduced coordination bandwidth.  
- **Deferred costs:** stabilization of avoidance or concealment scripts.

**Asymmetry pattern:**
- Roles with higher exposure incur higher shielding costs.  
- Roles with lower exposure retain interpretive and leverage advantages.

**System effect:**  
Exposure management becomes cheaper than integration, incentivizing early script formation.

---

### E. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)

Under sudden exposure and absent integration capacity, structurally reasonable responses include:

- **Inhibition (Χ)** as immediate exposure reduction.  
- **Boundary-setting** to limit legibility.  
- **Script repetition (Α)** to stabilize expectations.

What is **not** structurally required:
- Reflexive insight.  
- Moral acknowledgment.  
- Psychological processing.

These may occur later, but they are not necessary to explain the observed move.

---

### F. Χ Clarification — Distance as Protection, Not Reflection

**Critical distinction:**
- **Χ here ≠ reflective meta-position.**  
- **Χ here = reactive inhibition** that limits further exposure.

**Indicators:**
- Speed over deliberation.  
- Concealment over articulation.  
- Distance enacted without narrative explanation.

**Structural role:**  
Χ functions as a **damage-limiting operator**, preserving minimal standing under Ω, not as a truth-seeking pause.

---

### G. Script Formation (Α) and Early Stabilization

**Mechanism:**
- Protective acts repeat because they work locally.  
- Repetition lowers uncertainty.  
- The pattern becomes reliable.

**Result:**  
A shielding script stabilizes as **Α (attractor)** before any integration attempt occurs.

**Important:**  
This stabilization does not require intention, affect, or moral stance—only repeatability under cost pressure.

---

### H. Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)

This example **does not claim**:
- that agents feel shame or guilt,
- that concealment implies moral awareness,
- that exposure management equals deception.

It **does claim**:
- that exposure becomes structurally costly once Ω is legible,
- that early inhibition is a rational exposure-control move,
- that scripts can stabilize without reflection or affect.

---

### I. Dignity-in-Practice Stress Test (D under Ω)

**Risk point:**  
Shielding scripts can drift into standing manipulation or coercive opacity.

**Failure modes:**
- **Χ frozen:** inhibition becomes permanent avoidance.  
- **Ω leveraged:** exposure asymmetry used to control others.  
- **D violated:** shielding justifies degradation of exposed roles.

**Viability signal:**  
Shielding remains PMS-consistent only while it preserves reversibility and does not convert exposure gradients into domination.

---

### J. PMS Validity Check (Application Gate)

Any practical use of this mapping is PMS-valid **only if**:
- **Χ** is allowed to relax once exposure stabilizes,
- **Σ (integration)** remains a possible later step,
- **Φ (recontextualization)** does not rewrite shielding as moral virtue or vice,
- **Ψ (self-binding)** binds to restraint, not concealment dominance,
- **D (dignity-in-practice)** is preserved despite vulnerability.

Absent these constraints, fig-leaf dynamics harden into coercive opacity and are **formally invalid as PMS application**.

---

### K. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)

From this configuration, a stable structural outcome follows:
once exposure becomes legible under **Ω** and bound by **Θ**,
the first viable response is not understanding, but shielding.

The fig-leaf move establishes a new baseline:
visibility is now costly, and inhibition becomes protective.
This is not a psychological reaction, but a frame-consistent
response to altered exposure gradients.

What stabilizes is not concealment as intent,
but concealment as function.
Through repetition, protective inhibition crystallizes into **Α**
before any integration (**Σ**) is structurally available.

Later narratives may reinterpret this phase as insight,
shame, or moral awakening.
Structurally, however, nothing epistemic has occurred.
The system has only learned which exposures are unsafe.

PMS–EDEN therefore treats fig-leaf dynamics as
early-stage exposure management under asymmetry,
not as interior states, moral signals, or reflective achievement.
