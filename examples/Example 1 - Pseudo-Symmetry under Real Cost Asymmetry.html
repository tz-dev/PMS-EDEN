		<section id="content">
			<p><strong>Case label:</strong> <em>Equality Rhetoric vs. Irreversible Cost Gradients</em><br><strong>Scope discipline:</strong> Structural mapping only. No person diagnosis, no moral ranking, no prescriptive claims. PMS application validity remains conditional on <strong>Χ + reversibility + D</strong>.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)</h3>
			<p><strong>Scene ID:</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Θ (temporality):</strong> Extended interaction over time; repeated coordination attempts with accumulating consequences.  </li>
			<li><strong>□ (frame anchor):</strong> Initially <strong>□praxis</strong> (task/coordination-oriented), later drifting toward <strong>□comparison</strong> (equivalence/justification-oriented).  </li>
			<li><strong>Roles (not persons):</strong>  <ul>
			<li>Role R₁: proximity to end-point decisions and closure authority.  </li>
			<li>Role R₂: proximity to continuity work, relational maintenance, and fallout handling.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Trigger (Δ/∇):</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Δ:</strong> Unequal exposure to irreversible consequences becomes salient.  </li>
			<li><strong>∇:</strong> Pressure to “restore fairness” without reopening coordination interfaces.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Λ candidates (expected but missing):</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li>Explicit coordination of asymmetrical cost distribution.  </li>
			<li>Explicit renegotiation of roles and obligations under changed consequences.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Observed realizations (neutral):</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li>Increased rhetoric of equality and sameness.  </li>
			<li>Repeated comparison and justification cycles.  </li>
			<li>No durable interface change.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>B. Drift Trace (Operator-Readable)</h3>
			<p><code>Drift = □praxis → Ω-legible → □comparison → PS (pseudo-symmetry) → Α (stabilized comparison scripts) → Σ low/simulated → Ψ misbound</code></p>
			<p><strong>Key transitions:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> becomes legible in consequences but is treated as illegitimate to name.  </li>
			<li><strong>□ (frame)</strong> shifts from coordination to comparison.  </li>
			<li><strong>Pseudo-symmetry (PS)</strong> substitutes for integration: rhetorical equality replaces functional coordination.  </li>
			<li><strong>Α (attractor)</strong> stabilizes repeated comparison, justification, and leveling attempts.  </li>
			<li><strong>Σ (integration)</strong> remains low or simulated; interfaces do not consolidate.  </li>
			<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> attaches to appearance of fairness rather than to coordinated obligations.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>C. Cost Distribution (Structural, Not Moral)</h3>
			<p><strong>Irreversible vs. relational costs:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>R₁-adjacent costs:</strong>  <ul>
			<li>Point-of-decision costs; closure achieved with limited ongoing exposure.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>R₂-adjacent costs:</strong>  <ul>
			<li>Ongoing relational, repair, and continuity costs across <strong>Θ</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Cost asymmetry pattern:</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li>End-point roles absorb <strong>decision costs</strong> once.  </li>
			<li>Continuity roles absorb <strong>maintenance costs</strong> repeatedly.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>System effect:</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li>Pseudo-symmetry obscures this distribution, shifting real costs into invisible, durable load.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>D. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)</h3>
			<p>Under this cost profile, the following responses are <strong>structurally rational</strong> (not morally preferred):</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Comparison escalation</strong> where coordination is blocked and Ω is taboo.  </li>
			<li><strong>Persistence in maintenance work</strong> where exit would increase relational fallout.  </li>
			<li><strong>Withdrawal or mediation refusal</strong> where continuation becomes irreversibly expensive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These responses follow cost logic under <strong>Ω across Θ</strong>, not character traits or virtues.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>E. Dignity-in-Practice Stress Test (D under Ω)</h3>
			<p><strong>Risk point:</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li>“Equality” rhetoric becomes a <strong>shield</strong> that legitimizes coercion-by-frame when it demands sameness while ignoring real gradients.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Failure mode:</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Ψ→Other</strong>: Binding is externalized as “you must be fair / equal,” bypassing <strong>Χ</strong>.  </li>
			<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> is attacked as “avoidance” or “lack of commitment.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural indicator:</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li>Appeals to fairness function as emergency justification to suppress distance and force compliance.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>F. Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h3>
			<p>This example <strong>does not claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that equality is undesirable,</li>
			<li>that any role is morally superior,</li>
			<li>that cost-bearing implies virtue or victimhood,</li>
			<li>that asymmetry implies blame.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It <strong>does claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that equality rhetoric can function as a <strong>frame substitution</strong>,</li>
			<li>that pseudo-symmetry hides real cost gradients,</li>
			<li>that coercion can arise without moral language, purely through frame control.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>G. PMS Validity Check (Application Gate)</h3>
			<p>Any attempt to <em>use</em> this analysis for action or binding is PMS-valid <strong>only if</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> is preserved as reversible restraint,</li>
			<li>real <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is nameable and coordinable,</li>
			<li><strong>D (dignity-in-practice)</strong> constrains how asymmetry is handled,</li>
			<li>binding remains <strong>Ψ→Self</strong>, not enforced as <strong>Ψ→Other</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Absent these conditions, the analysis may still describe the situation, but any prescriptive use is <strong>formally invalid as PMS application</strong>.</p>
			<h3>H. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)</h3>
			<p>
			From this configuration, a clear structural consequence follows:
			once equality rhetoric replaces coordination under real <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> across
			<strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>, the system no longer negotiates costs—it redistributes them invisibly.
			</p>
			<p>
			Pseudo-symmetry does not resolve asymmetry; it stabilizes it by relocating consequences from explicit
			interfaces into durable relational load.
			What appears as fairness maintenance functions structurally as a
			<strong>cost-masking attractor (Α)</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
			At this stage, further comparison does not reopen coordination.
			Instead, it increases justification pressure, accelerates leveling cycles, and raises the likelihood
			of coercion-by-frame.
			<strong>Χ (distance)</strong> becomes structurally threatened—not due to deficient intent, but because the
			dominant <strong>□ (frame)</strong> no longer tolerates restraint.
			</p>
			<p>
			This outcome is neither a failure of character nor of intention.
			It is the predictable result of maintaining equivalence talk where asymmetrical consequences are
			already irreversible.
