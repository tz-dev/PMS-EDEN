## Example 1: Pseudo-Symmetry under Real Cost Asymmetry

**Case label:** *Equality Rhetoric vs. Irreversible Cost Gradients*  
**Scope discipline:** Structural mapping only. No person diagnosis, no moral ranking, no prescriptive claims. PMS application validity remains conditional on **Χ + reversibility + D**.

### A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)

**Scene ID:**  
- **Θ (temporality):** Extended interaction over time; repeated coordination attempts with accumulating consequences.  
- **□ (frame anchor):** Initially **□praxis** (task/coordination-oriented), later drifting toward **□comparison** (equivalence/justification-oriented).  
- **Roles (not persons):**  
  - Role R₁: proximity to end-point decisions and closure authority.  
  - Role R₂: proximity to continuity work, relational maintenance, and fallout handling.

**Trigger (Δ/∇):**  
- **Δ:** Unequal exposure to irreversible consequences becomes salient.  
- **∇:** Pressure to “restore fairness” without reopening coordination interfaces.

**Λ candidates (expected but missing):**  
- Explicit coordination of asymmetrical cost distribution.  
- Explicit renegotiation of roles and obligations under changed consequences.

**Observed realizations (neutral):**  
- Increased rhetoric of equality and sameness.  
- Repeated comparison and justification cycles.  
- No durable interface change.

### B. Drift Trace (Operator-Readable)

`Drift = □praxis → Ω-legible → □comparison → PS (pseudo-symmetry) → Α (stabilized comparison scripts) → Σ low/simulated → Ψ misbound`

**Key transitions:**
- **Ω (asymmetry)** becomes legible in consequences but is treated as illegitimate to name.  
- **□ (frame)** shifts from coordination to comparison.  
- **Pseudo-symmetry (PS)** substitutes for integration: rhetorical equality replaces functional coordination.  
- **Α (attractor)** stabilizes repeated comparison, justification, and leveling attempts.  
- **Σ (integration)** remains low or simulated; interfaces do not consolidate.  
- **Ψ (self-binding)** attaches to appearance of fairness rather than to coordinated obligations.

### C. Cost Distribution (Structural, Not Moral)

**Irreversible vs. relational costs:**
- **R₁-adjacent costs:**  
  - Point-of-decision costs; closure achieved with limited ongoing exposure.  
- **R₂-adjacent costs:**  
  - Ongoing relational, repair, and continuity costs across **Θ**.

**Cost asymmetry pattern:**  
- End-point roles absorb **decision costs** once.  
- Continuity roles absorb **maintenance costs** repeatedly.

**System effect:**  
- Pseudo-symmetry obscures this distribution, shifting real costs into invisible, durable load.

### D. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)

Under this cost profile, the following responses are **structurally rational** (not morally preferred):

- **Comparison escalation** where coordination is blocked and Ω is taboo.  
- **Persistence in maintenance work** where exit would increase relational fallout.  
- **Withdrawal or mediation refusal** where continuation becomes irreversibly expensive.

These responses follow cost logic under **Ω across Θ**, not character traits or virtues.

---

### E. Dignity-in-Practice Stress Test (D under Ω)

**Risk point:**  
- “Equality” rhetoric becomes a **shield** that legitimizes coercion-by-frame when it demands sameness while ignoring real gradients.

**Failure mode:**  
- **Ψ→Other**: Binding is externalized as “you must be fair / equal,” bypassing **Χ**.  
- **Χ (distance)** is attacked as “avoidance” or “lack of commitment.”

**Structural indicator:**  
- Appeals to fairness function as emergency justification to suppress distance and force compliance.

---

### F. Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)

This example **does not claim**:
- that equality is undesirable,
- that any role is morally superior,
- that cost-bearing implies virtue or victimhood,
- that asymmetry implies blame.

It **does claim**:
- that equality rhetoric can function as a **frame substitution**,
- that pseudo-symmetry hides real cost gradients,
- that coercion can arise without moral language, purely through frame control.

---

### G. PMS Validity Check (Application Gate)

Any attempt to *use* this analysis for action or binding is PMS-valid **only if**:
- **Χ (distance)** is preserved as reversible restraint,
- real **Ω (asymmetry)** is nameable and coordinable,
- **D (dignity-in-practice)** constrains how asymmetry is handled,
- binding remains **Ψ→Self**, not enforced as **Ψ→Other**.

Absent these conditions, the analysis may still describe the situation, but any prescriptive use is **formally invalid as PMS application**.

---

### H. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)

From this configuration, a clear structural consequence follows:
once equality rhetoric replaces coordination under real **Ω (asymmetry)** across **Θ (temporality)**, the system no longer negotiates costs—it redistributes them invisibly.

This stabilization follows the same loss-avoidance logic described in NRK (§5): once coordination under real Ω would require irreversible re-internalization of costs under Θ, maintaining the post-breach configuration becomes structurally cheaper than repair.

Pseudo-symmetry does not resolve asymmetry; it stabilizes it by relocating consequences from explicit interfaces into durable relational load.
What appears as fairness maintenance functions structurally as a **cost-masking attractor (Α)**.

At this stage, further comparison does not reopen coordination.
Instead, it increases justification pressure, accelerates leveling cycles, and raises the likelihood of coercion-by-frame.
**Χ (distance)** becomes structurally threatened—not due to deficient intent, but because the dominant **□ (frame)** no longer tolerates restraint.

This outcome is neither a failure of character nor of intention.
It is the predictable result of maintaining equivalence talk where asymmetrical consequences are already irreversible.
