			<h2><em>Example 4: Legibility Management Without Psychology</em></h2>
		</header>
		<section id="content">
			<p><strong>Case label:</strong> <em>Shielding, Exposure, and the Birth of Stabilized Scripts</em><br><strong>Scope discipline:</strong> Structural description only. No shame/guilt psychology, no interior states, no moral affect attribution. All claims remain at the level of frames, operators, and observable stabilizations. PMS application remains conditional on <strong>Χ + reversibility + D</strong>.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)</h3>
			<p><strong>Scene ID:</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Θ (temporality):</strong> Immediate post-breach interval; trajectory already altered, but scripts not yet stabilized.  </li>
			<li><strong>□ (frame anchor):</strong> Shift from <strong>□praxis</strong> (coordination-first) to <strong>□vulnerability</strong> (exposure-first).  </li>
			<li><strong>Roles (not persons):</strong>  <ul>
			<li>Role R₁: position newly exposed by consequence-legibility.  </li>
			<li>Role R₂: position capable of observing, reacting to, or leveraging exposure.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Trigger (Δ/∇):</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Δ:</strong> A newly salient distinction between “exposed” and “shielded.”  </li>
			<li><strong>∇:</strong> Directed impulse to reduce exposure immediately (not to explain, justify, or integrate).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Λ candidates (expected but missing):</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li>Immediate reintegration into prior coordination.  </li>
			<li>A frame where exposure has no relevance.  </li>
			<li>Symmetrical legibility of vulnerability across roles.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Observed realizations (neutral):</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li>Covering, hiding, or boundary-setting behaviors.  </li>
			<li>Reduction of visibility rather than expansion of coordination.  </li>
			<li>Early repetition of protective moves.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>B. Drift Trace (Operator-Readable)</h3>
			<p><code>Drift = breach → Θ binds exposure → Ω becomes legible → □ shifts to vulnerability → Χ appears as inhibition → Α (protective scripts) → Φ later narrativizes</code></p>
			<p><strong>Key transitions:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> becomes readable as differential exposure.  </li>
			<li><strong>□ (frame)</strong> pivots to vulnerability management.  </li>
			<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> appears as <strong>protective inhibition</strong>, not reflective pause.  </li>
			<li><strong>Α (attractor)</strong> begins to stabilize repeatable shielding scripts.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>C. Structural Result (What Is Established)</h3>
			<ul>
			<li>Exposure becomes a primary relevance criterion.  </li>
			<li>Visibility is treated as costly.  </li>
			<li>Early inhibition patterns acquire stabilizing force.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural claim:</strong><br>The “fig leaf” is not an emotion or confession, but a <strong>frame-compatible shielding operation</strong> that manages exposure under newly legible asymmetry.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>D. Cost Distribution (Structural, Not Psychological)</h3>
			<p><strong>Cost types:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Immediate costs:</strong> loss of transparency, reduced coordination bandwidth.  </li>
			<li><strong>Deferred costs:</strong> stabilization of avoidance or concealment scripts.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Asymmetry pattern:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Roles with higher exposure incur higher shielding costs.  </li>
			<li>Roles with lower exposure retain interpretive and leverage advantages.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>System effect:</strong><br>Exposure management becomes cheaper than integration, incentivizing early script formation.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>E. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)</h3>
			<p>Under sudden exposure and absent integration capacity, structurally reasonable responses include:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Inhibition (Χ)</strong> as immediate exposure reduction.  </li>
			<li><strong>Boundary-setting</strong> to limit legibility.  </li>
			<li><strong>Script repetition (Α)</strong> to stabilize expectations.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>What is <strong>not</strong> structurally required:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Reflexive insight.  </li>
			<li>Moral acknowledgment.  </li>
			<li>Psychological processing.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These may occur later, but they are not necessary to explain the observed move.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>F. Χ Clarification — Distance as Protection, Not Reflection</h3>
			<p><strong>Critical distinction:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Χ here ≠ reflective meta-position.</strong>  </li>
			<li><strong>Χ here = reactive inhibition</strong> that limits further exposure.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Indicators:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Speed over deliberation.  </li>
			<li>Concealment over articulation.  </li>
			<li>Distance enacted without narrative explanation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural role:</strong><br>Χ functions as a <strong>damage-limiting operator</strong>, preserving minimal standing under Ω, not as a truth-seeking pause.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>G. Script Formation (Α) and Early Stabilization</h3>
			<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Protective acts repeat because they work locally.  </li>
			<li>Repetition lowers uncertainty.  </li>
			<li>The pattern becomes reliable.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Result:</strong><br>A shielding script stabilizes as <strong>Α (attractor)</strong> before any integration attempt occurs.</p>
			<p><strong>Important:</strong><br>This stabilization does not require intention, affect, or moral stance—only repeatability under cost pressure.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>H. Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h3>
			<p>This example <strong>does not claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that agents feel shame or guilt,</li>
			<li>that concealment implies moral awareness,</li>
			<li>that exposure management equals deception.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It <strong>does claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that exposure becomes structurally costly once Ω is legible,</li>
			<li>that early inhibition is a rational exposure-control move,</li>
			<li>that scripts can stabilize without reflection or affect.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>I. Dignity-in-Practice Stress Test (D under Ω)</h3>
			<p><strong>Risk point:</strong><br>Shielding scripts can drift into standing manipulation or coercive opacity.</p>
			<p><strong>Failure modes:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Χ frozen:</strong> inhibition becomes permanent avoidance.  </li>
			<li><strong>Ω leveraged:</strong> exposure asymmetry used to control others.  </li>
			<li><strong>D violated:</strong> shielding justifies degradation of exposed roles.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Viability signal:</strong><br>Shielding remains PMS-consistent only while it preserves reversibility and does not convert exposure gradients into domination.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>J. PMS Validity Check (Application Gate)</h3>
			<p>Any practical use of this mapping is PMS-valid <strong>only if</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Χ</strong> is allowed to relax once exposure stabilizes,</li>
			<li><strong>Σ (integration)</strong> remains a possible later step,</li>
			<li><strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong> does not rewrite shielding as moral virtue or vice,</li>
			<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> binds to restraint, not concealment dominance,</li>
			<li><strong>D (dignity-in-practice)</strong> is preserved despite vulnerability.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Absent these constraints, fig-leaf dynamics harden into coercive opacity and are <strong>formally invalid as PMS application</strong>.</p>
			<h3>K. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)</h3>
			<p>
			From this configuration, a stable structural outcome follows:
			once exposure becomes legible under <strong>Ω</strong> and bound by <strong>Θ</strong>,
			the first viable response is not understanding, but shielding.
			</p>
			<p>
			The fig-leaf move establishes a new baseline:
			visibility is now costly, and inhibition becomes protective.
			This is not a psychological reaction, but a frame-consistent
			response to altered exposure gradients.
			</p>
			<p>
			What stabilizes is not concealment as intent,
			but concealment as function.
			Through repetition, protective inhibition crystallizes into <strong>Α</strong>
			before any integration (<strong>Σ</strong>) is structurally available.
			</p>
			<p>
			Later narratives may reinterpret this phase as insight,
			shame, or moral awakening.
			Structurally, however, nothing epistemic has occurred.
			The system has only learned which exposures are unsafe.
			</p>
			<p>
			PMS–EDEN therefore treats fig-leaf dynamics as
			early-stage exposure management under asymmetry,
			not as interior states, moral signals, or reflective achievement.
