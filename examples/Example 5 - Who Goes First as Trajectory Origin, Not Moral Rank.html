		<section id="content">
			<p><strong>Case label:</strong> <em>Priority as Asymmetry-Origin Under Irreversibility</em><br><strong>Scope discipline:</strong> Structural description only. No guilt attribution, no intent inference, no moral ranking. The analysis tracks sequence, asymmetry, and temporal binding. PMS application remains conditional on <strong>Χ + reversibility + D</strong>.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)</h3>
			<p><strong>Scene ID:</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Θ (temporality):</strong> A sequence-opening moment where order matters and cannot be replayed.  </li>
			<li><strong>□ (frame anchor):</strong> Praxis coordination frame with a pending interface (decision, action, commitment).  </li>
			<li><strong>Roles (not persons):</strong>  <ul>
			<li>Role R₁: position that acts or commits first.  </li>
			<li>Role R₂: position that responds second, under altered conditions.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Trigger (Δ/∇):</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Δ:</strong> Distinction between “before” and “after” the first move.  </li>
			<li><strong>∇:</strong> Directed pressure to resolve indeterminacy by acting.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Λ candidates (expected but missing):</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li>Simultaneous action.  </li>
			<li>A cost-free reset after sequence initiation.  </li>
			<li>A neutral ordering without consequence effects.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Observed realizations (neutral):</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li>One role initiates action or commitment.  </li>
			<li>The other role’s option set shifts immediately.  </li>
			<li>Sequence becomes fixed.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>B. Core Structural Claim</h3>
			<p><strong>Priority is not rank.</strong><br>The first move does not establish superiority, virtue, or blame. It establishes an <strong>origin gradient</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> emerges from sequence, not character.  </li>
			<li><strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> binds consequences irreversibly.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once the first move occurs, the scene is no longer symmetric—even if rhetoric later insists otherwise.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>C. Drift Trace (Operator-Readable)</h3>
			<p><code>Drift = indeterminacy → first move → Ω(origin gradient) → Θ(binding) → Φ(repair narratives) → Α(pseudo-symmetry pressure)</code></p>
			<p><strong>Key transitions:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Ω:</strong> directional asymmetry appears (who reacted to whom).  </li>
			<li><strong>Θ:</strong> the trajectory locks; rewind is impossible.  </li>
			<li><strong>Φ:</strong> narratives attempt to rebalance meaning.  </li>
			<li><strong>Α:</strong> scripts form to deny or smooth the asymmetry.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>D. What “First” Actually Does (Structural Effects)</h3>
			<p>The first move:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Defines the <strong>reference point</strong> for all later interpretation.  </li>
			<li>Shifts burden of adjustment asymmetrically.  </li>
			<li>Creates exposure gradients that did not exist before.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Important:</strong><br>These effects occur regardless of intention, justification, or fairness talk.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>E. Common Misread: From Origin to Guilt</h3>
			<p><strong>Typical slide:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Sequence origin → responsibility → blame → moral rank.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural correction:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Mitverantwortung ≠ Mit-Schuld.</strong>  </li>
			<li>Responsibility here tracks <strong>causal positioning under Θ</strong>, not wrongdoing.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Turning origin into guilt is a <strong>frame substitution</strong> (often □moral) that overwrites sequence logic.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>F. Recontextualization Pressure (Φ)</h3>
			<p>After irreversibility sets in, Φ becomes active:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>“We were both equally involved.”  </li>
			<li>“It doesn’t matter who started.”  </li>
			<li>“Let’s treat this as symmetric now.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural function of Φ here:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Reduce tension created by Ω-origin.  </li>
			<li>Restore interactional comfort.  </li>
			<li>Suppress trajectory asymmetry without undoing it.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Risk:</strong><br>Φ can simulate closure while leaving Ω fully operative.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>G. Pseudo-Symmetry Formation (Α)</h3>
			<p>If repeated, the following stabilizes:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Rhetorical equality.  </li>
			<li>Rotating justifications.  </li>
			<li>Pressure to ignore origin effects.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This forms an <strong>Α (attractor)</strong> where symmetry is <em>performed</em> rather than coordinated, often increasing dissatisfaction over time.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>H. Cost Profile (Structural, Not Moral)</h3>
			<p><strong>Costs introduced by first-move irreversibility:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>For R₁:</strong> origin accountability persists across Θ.  </li>
			<li><strong>For R₂:</strong> constrained response space and reactive positioning.  </li>
			<li><strong>For the system:</strong> ongoing effort to narratively neutralize asymmetry.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These costs are unavoidable once sequence is set.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>I. Reversibility Clause (Critical Distinction)</h3>
			<p><strong>Key PMS distinction:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Scene irreversibility (Θ)</strong> ≠ <strong>application irreversibility</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The event cannot be undone, but <strong>how it is handled</strong> remains subject to PMS validity constraints.</p>
			<p><strong>Application must preserve:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Χ:</strong> distance from blame inflation.  </li>
			<li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> openness to revised coordination going forward.  </li>
			<li><strong>D:</strong> restraint in handling origin-based asymmetry.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Using irreversibility to justify coercion or moral capture is PMS-invalid.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>J. χ (Distance) as Anti-Scorekeeping Operator</h3>
			<p><strong>Χ function here:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Prevents sequence from becoming verdict.  </li>
			<li>Keeps origin legible without turning it into accusation.  </li>
			<li>Allows coordination without purification rituals (“who’s at fault”).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When Χ collapses, origin asymmetry is moralized and weaponized.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>K. PMS Validity Check (Application Gate)</h3>
			<p>A PMS-consistent handling of “who goes first” requires:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Naming origin asymmetry without converting it into guilt.  </li>
			<li>Accepting Θ-bound irreversibility without retroactive purity tests.  </li>
			<li>Allowing Φ to reinterpret meaning, not erase sequence effects.  </li>
			<li>Binding future commitments (<strong>Ψ</strong>) to coordination, not to score-settling.  </li>
			<li>Preserving <strong>D (dignity-in-practice)</strong> under unequal exposure.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Failure to meet these conditions turns sequence into moral rank and constitutes <strong>formal misuse of PMS</strong>.</p>
			<h3>L. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)</h3>
			<p>
			From this configuration, a clear structural consequence follows:
			sequence produces asymmetry before any meaning, evaluation, or intent attribution.
			</p>
			<p>
			The first move does not establish virtue, fault, or authority.
			It establishes an origin point that binds trajectories under <strong>Θ</strong>
			and redistributes adjustment costs under <strong>Ω</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
			Once sequence is set, symmetry can no longer be restored as structure.
			It can only be simulated through narrative, comparison, or moral framing.
			Such simulations may reduce tension, but they do not undo origin gradients.
			</p>
			<p>
			What persists is not blame, but positioning.
			Responsibility here is temporal and relational, not ethical by default.
			Misreading origin as guilt is therefore not an insight, but a frame substitution.
			</p>
			<p>
			PMS–EDEN treats “who goes first” as a trajectory-forming event:
			it creates durable asymmetry without implying wrongdoing,
			and it demands restraint (<strong>Χ</strong>) precisely to prevent sequence from becoming verdict.
