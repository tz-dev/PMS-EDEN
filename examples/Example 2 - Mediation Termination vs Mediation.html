		<section id="content">
			<p><strong>Case label:</strong> <em>Mediation Collapse as Cost-Rational, Not Character</em><br><strong>Scope discipline:</strong> Structural mapping only. No gender coding, no person diagnosis, no moral ranking. PMS application validity remains conditional on <strong>Χ + reversibility + D</strong>.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)</h3>
			<p><strong>Scene ID:</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Θ (temporality):</strong> Post-breach trajectory with accumulating residues; prior attempts at repair already consumed.  </li>
			<li><strong>□ (frame anchor):</strong> Initially <strong>□praxis</strong> (coordination/repair), drifting toward <strong>□security</strong> and <strong>□comparison</strong> (damage control and fairness accounting).  </li>
			<li><strong>Roles (not persons):</strong>  <ul>
			<li>Role R₁: proximity to end-point authority and exit capacity.  </li>
			<li>Role R₂: proximity to continuity, mediation labor, and relational carry-over.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Trigger (Δ/∇):</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Δ:</strong> A breach renders asymmetrical consequences explicit.  </li>
			<li><strong>∇:</strong> Pressure to “fix” or “keep it together” without reopening role interfaces.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Λ candidates (expected but missing):</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li>Explicit acknowledgment of irreversible costs already incurred.  </li>
			<li>Explicit redistribution or renegotiation of mediation load.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Observed realizations (neutral):</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li>Repeated calls for “talking it through” without interface change.  </li>
			<li>Defensive distancing or hard exit moves.  </li>
			<li>Escalating meta-conflict about effort and fairness.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>B. Drift Trace (Operator-Readable)</h3>
			<p><code>Drift = breach → Ω-legible + Θ-irreversible → □security / □comparison → Α (mediation scripts) → Σ suppressed → Ψ polarized (exit-binding vs. carry-binding)</code></p>
			<p><strong>Key transitions:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> becomes salient in who can exit vs. who must carry fallout.  </li>
			<li><strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> makes prior costs non-resettable.  </li>
			<li><strong>□ (frame)</strong> shifts toward safety and accounting, penalizing further interface work.  </li>
			<li><strong>Α (attractor)</strong> stabilizes scripts: “try harder to mediate” vs. “set a hard boundary.”  </li>
			<li><strong>Σ (integration)</strong> is suppressed; mediation repeats without consolidation.  </li>
			<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> polarizes: binding to exit on one side, binding to continuity on the other.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>C. Cost Distribution (Structural, Not Moral)</h3>
			<p><strong>Cost types:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Exit / end-point costs:</strong>  <ul>
			<li>Immediate rupture, reputational fallout, loss of continuity.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Continuation / mediation costs:</strong>  <ul>
			<li>Ongoing emotional, temporal, and coordination load across <strong>Θ</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Asymmetry pattern:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Roles nearer to exit capacity incur <strong>one-time decision costs</strong>.  </li>
			<li>Roles nearer to continuity incur <strong>recurring mediation costs</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>System effect:</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li>When mediation costs become <strong>irreversibly cumulative</strong>, continued mediation becomes structurally expensive beyond repair value.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>D. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)</h3>
			<p>Under asymmetric irreversibility, the following responses are <strong>structurally rational</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Mediation termination</strong> where further mediation adds cost without reopening Σ-capable interfaces.  </li>
			<li><strong>Mediation persistence</strong> where exit would externalize higher downstream costs (social, institutional, or relational).  </li>
			<li><strong>Formalization or withdrawal</strong> as cost-containment strategies when informal mediation is exhausted.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are <strong>cost responses</strong>, not indicators of maturity, empathy, or deficiency.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>E. Role vs. Person Separation (Critical Discipline)</h3>
			<p><strong>Explicit separation:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Role position / cost exposure ≠ personal disposition.</strong>  </li>
			<li>End-point setting does not imply coldness or dominance.  </li>
			<li>Continuity carrying does not imply virtue or self-sacrifice.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural indicator:</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li>The same person can rationally occupy either response in different scenes, depending on <strong>Ω + Θ</strong> configuration.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>F. Dignity-in-Practice Stress Test (D under Ω)</h3>
			<p><strong>Risk point:</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li>Mediation becomes <strong>morally mandatory</strong> rather than structurally viable.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Failure modes:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Ψ→Other:</strong> “You must keep mediating” imposed as obligation.  </li>
			<li><strong>Χ suppressed:</strong> Distance framed as abandonment or aggression.  </li>
			<li><strong>D violated:</strong> Asymmetry handled via coercive endurance demands.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural signal:</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li>Mediation persists despite clear evidence that Σ cannot consolidate and Λ continues to accumulate.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>G. Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h3>
			<p>This example <strong>does not claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that one response is morally superior,</li>
			<li>that exit is masculine or mediation is feminine,</li>
			<li>that refusal to mediate equals immaturity,</li>
			<li>that continued mediation equals virtue.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It <strong>does claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that mediation is a <strong>structural performance</strong>, not a moral duty,</li>
			<li>that its termination can mark <strong>cost saturation</strong>, not character failure,</li>
			<li>that asymmetry and temporality determine mediation viability.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>H. PMS Validity Check (Application Gate)</h3>
			<p>Any attempt to <em>use</em> this analysis for action or binding is PMS-valid <strong>only if</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> remains reversible and self-applied,</li>
			<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is explicitly named rather than moralized,</li>
			<li><strong>Σ (integration)</strong> is required as a criterion, not presumed,</li>
			<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> stays self-bound and dignity-preserving (<strong>D</strong>).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Absent these conditions, mediation pressure becomes coercive and any application is <strong>formally invalid as PMS</strong>.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>I. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)</h3>
			<p>From this configuration, a stable structural outcome follows:
			when mediation continues under real <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> and irreversible <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> without reopening <strong>Σ-capable interfaces</strong>, mediation ceases to function as coordination and becomes cost displacement.</p>
			<p>What presents as commitment to repair increasingly operates as a <strong>carry-demand attractor (Α)</strong>:
			costs are no longer negotiated, but accumulated by the continuity-proximal role.
			Mediation, once a coordination practice, mutates into an endurance requirement.</p>
			<p>This stabilization follows the same breach logic formalized as NRK (§5): once mediation continues after the repair window has closed under Θ, reopening coordination under real Ω becomes structurally more expensive than maintaining the post-breach configuration.</p>
			<p>At this stage, terminating mediation is not a breakdown of responsibility.
			It is a structurally coherent response to cost saturation where further mediation no longer changes the consequence field.
			Conversely, insisting on mediation under these conditions tends to suppress <strong>Χ (distance)</strong> and externalize binding as obligation.</p>
			<p>This outcome is not explained by temperament, empathy, or virtue.
			It is the predictable result of maintaining repair scripts after the repair window has closed.</p>
