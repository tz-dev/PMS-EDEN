## Example 2 - Mediation Termination vs. Mediation Compulsion

**Case label:** *Mediation Collapse as Cost-Rational, Not Character*  
**Scope discipline:** Structural mapping only. No gender coding, no person diagnosis, no moral ranking. PMS application validity remains conditional on **Χ + reversibility + D**.

### A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)

**Scene ID:**  
- **Θ (temporality):** Post-breach trajectory with accumulating residues; prior attempts at repair already consumed.  
- **□ (frame anchor):** Initially **□praxis** (coordination/repair), drifting toward **□security** and **□comparison** (damage control and fairness accounting).  
- **Roles (not persons):**  
  - Role R₁: proximity to end-point authority and exit capacity.  
  - Role R₂: proximity to continuity, mediation labor, and relational carry-over.

**Trigger (Δ/∇):**  
- **Δ:** A breach renders asymmetrical consequences explicit.  
- **∇:** Pressure to “fix” or “keep it together” without reopening role interfaces.

**Λ candidates (expected but missing):**  
- Explicit acknowledgment of irreversible costs already incurred.  
- Explicit redistribution or renegotiation of mediation load.

**Observed realizations (neutral):**  
- Repeated calls for “talking it through” without interface change.  
- Defensive distancing or hard exit moves.  
- Escalating meta-conflict about effort and fairness.

### B. Drift Trace (Operator-Readable)

`Drift = breach → Ω-legible + Θ-irreversible → □security / □comparison → Α (mediation scripts) → Σ suppressed → Ψ polarized (exit-binding vs. carry-binding)`

**Key transitions:**
- **Ω (asymmetry)** becomes salient in who can exit vs. who must carry fallout.  
- **Θ (temporality)** makes prior costs non-resettable.  
- **□ (frame)** shifts toward safety and accounting, penalizing further interface work.  
- **Α (attractor)** stabilizes scripts: “try harder to mediate” vs. “set a hard boundary.”  
- **Σ (integration)** is suppressed; mediation repeats without consolidation.  
- **Ψ (self-binding)** polarizes: binding to exit on one side, binding to continuity on the other.

### C. Cost Distribution (Structural, Not Moral)

**Cost types:**
- **Exit / end-point costs:**  
  - Immediate rupture, reputational fallout, loss of continuity.  
- **Continuation / mediation costs:**  
  - Ongoing emotional, temporal, and coordination load across **Θ**.

**Asymmetry pattern:**
- Roles nearer to exit capacity incur **one-time decision costs**.  
- Roles nearer to continuity incur **recurring mediation costs**.

**System effect:**  
- When mediation costs become **irreversibly cumulative**, continued mediation becomes structurally expensive beyond repair value.

### D. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)

Under asymmetric irreversibility, the following responses are **structurally rational**:

- **Mediation termination** where further mediation adds cost without reopening Σ-capable interfaces.  
- **Mediation persistence** where exit would externalize higher downstream costs (social, institutional, or relational).  
- **Formalization or withdrawal** as cost-containment strategies when informal mediation is exhausted.

These are **cost responses**, not indicators of maturity, empathy, or deficiency.

---

### E. Role vs. Person Separation (Critical Discipline)

**Explicit separation:**
- **Role position / cost exposure ≠ personal disposition.**  
- End-point setting does not imply coldness or dominance.  
- Continuity carrying does not imply virtue or self-sacrifice.

**Structural indicator:**  
- The same person can rationally occupy either response in different scenes, depending on **Ω + Θ** configuration.

---

### F. Dignity-in-Practice Stress Test (D under Ω)

**Risk point:**  
- Mediation becomes **morally mandatory** rather than structurally viable.

**Failure modes:**
- **Ψ→Other:** “You must keep mediating” imposed as obligation.  
- **Χ suppressed:** Distance framed as abandonment or aggression.  
- **D violated:** Asymmetry handled via coercive endurance demands.

**Structural signal:**  
- Mediation persists despite clear evidence that Σ cannot consolidate and Λ continues to accumulate.

---

### G. Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)

This example **does not claim**:
- that one response is morally superior,
- that exit is masculine or mediation is feminine,
- that refusal to mediate equals immaturity,
- that continued mediation equals virtue.

It **does claim**:
- that mediation is a **structural performance**, not a moral duty,
- that its termination can mark **cost saturation**, not character failure,
- that asymmetry and temporality determine mediation viability.

---

### H. PMS Validity Check (Application Gate)

Any attempt to *use* this analysis for action or binding is PMS-valid **only if**:
- **Χ (distance)** remains reversible and self-applied,
- **Ω (asymmetry)** is explicitly named rather than moralized,
- **Σ (integration)** is required as a criterion, not presumed,
- **Ψ (self-binding)** stays self-bound and dignity-preserving (**D**).

Absent these conditions, mediation pressure becomes coercive and any application is **formally invalid as PMS**.

---

### I. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)

From this configuration, a stable structural outcome follows:
when mediation continues under real **Ω (asymmetry)** and irreversible **Θ (temporality)** without reopening **Σ-capable interfaces**, mediation ceases to function as coordination and becomes cost displacement.

What presents as commitment to repair increasingly operates as a **carry-demand attractor (Α)**:
costs are no longer negotiated, but accumulated by the continuity-proximal role.
Mediation, once a coordination practice, mutates into an endurance requirement.

At this stage, terminating mediation is not a breakdown of responsibility.
It is a structurally coherent response to cost saturation where further mediation no longer changes the consequence field.
Conversely, insisting on mediation under these conditions tends to suppress **Χ (distance)** and externalize binding as obligation.

This outcome is not explained by temperament, empathy, or virtue.
It is the predictable result of maintaining repair scripts after the repair window has closed.
