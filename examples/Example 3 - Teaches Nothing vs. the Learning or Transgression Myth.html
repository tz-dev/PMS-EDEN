		</header>
		<section id="content">
			<p><strong>Case label:</strong> <em>The Fall as Consequence-Legibility Without Epistemic Gain</em><br><strong>Scope discipline:</strong> Structural mapping only. No psychology of insight, no moral pedagogy, no heroics of transgression. PMS application validity remains conditional on <strong>Χ + reversibility + D</strong>.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)</h3>
			<p><strong>Scene ID:</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Θ (temporality):</strong> Threshold-crossing with irreversible trajectory activation; before/after cannot be collapsed.  </li>
			<li><strong>□ (frame anchor):</strong> Initially <strong>□praxis</strong> (coordinated availability under non-scarcity), shifting to <strong>□comparison / □security</strong> once consequences bind.  </li>
			<li><strong>Roles (not persons):</strong>  <ul>
			<li>Role R₁: capacity to initiate the threshold act.  </li>
			<li>Role R₂: exposure to downstream consequences once the field changes.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Trigger (Δ/∇):</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Δ:</strong> A distinction already legible (options are visible).  </li>
			<li><strong>∇:</strong> Directed impulse to cross the threshold despite available alternatives.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Λ candidates (expected but missing):</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li>A reversible trial outcome.  </li>
			<li>A return path that restores the pre-threshold field.  </li>
			<li>An epistemic increment that expands the option set.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Observed realizations (neutral):</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li>Immediate binding of consequences.  </li>
			<li>Closure of prior reversibility windows.  </li>
			<li>Emergence of monitoring, protection, and accounting behaviors.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>B. Drift Trace (Operator-Readable)</h3>
			<p><code>Drift = threshold act → Θ binds trajectory → Ω becomes salient → Λ persists → □ shifts to comparison/security → Α (legibility-management scripts) → Φ produces learning narratives</code></p>
			<p><strong>Key transitions:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> converts the act into a non-resettable event.  </li>
			<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> becomes readable in who bears which costs.  </li>
			<li><strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> appears as the missing “clean outcome” and persists.  </li>
			<li><strong>□ (frame)</strong> pivots toward comparison and security to manage exposure.  </li>
			<li><strong>Α (attractor)</strong> stabilizes scripts for coping and justification.  </li>
			<li><strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong> generates post-hoc narratives labeled as “learning.”</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>C. Structural Result (What Is Established)</h3>
			<ul>
			<li>No new <strong>Δ</strong> is generated; distinctions were already available.  </li>
			<li>No expansion of the option space occurs.  </li>
			<li>What changes is <strong>legibility</strong>: consequences, gradients, and residues become visible and binding under <strong>Θ</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural claim:</strong><br>The act produces <strong>consequence-legibility</strong>, not <strong>epistemic gain</strong>.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>D. Cost Distribution (Structural, Not Moral)</h3>
			<p><strong>Cost types:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Irreversible costs:</strong> locked trajectories, lost reversibility, durable exposure.  </li>
			<li><strong>Ongoing costs:</strong> monitoring, protection, and coordination under altered frames.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Asymmetry pattern:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Initiation capacity does not equal cost absorption.  </li>
			<li>Exposure and carry-over distribute unevenly across roles once <strong>Θ</strong> binds.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>System effect:</strong><br>The system must now pay continuous management costs for a field that can no longer return to its prior configuration.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>E. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)</h3>
			<p>Given consequence-legibility without option expansion, structurally reasonable responses include:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Recontextualization (Φ)</strong> to stabilize meaning under loss.  </li>
			<li><strong>Formalization</strong> to manage new exposure gradients.  </li>
			<li><strong>Boundary-setting</strong> to contain irreversible costs.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>What is <strong>not</strong> structurally warranted:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Treating the event as an instructional upgrade.  </li>
			<li>Assuming increased maturity or insight as a necessary outcome.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>F. Learning-Narrative Production (Post-hoc Φ)</h3>
			<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong> reframes endurance, adaptation, or damage control as “learning.”  </li>
			<li>Narrative coherence substitutes for option expansion.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Diagnostic indicator:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Claims of learning appear <strong>after</strong> consequences bind and serve to justify persistence, not to open new paths.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural distinction:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Adaptation under constraint ≠ learning via differentiation.</strong>  </li>
			<li>The former manages costs; the latter expands the option set. Only the former occurs here.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>G. Dignity-in-Practice Stress Test (D under Ω)</h3>
			<p><strong>Risk point:</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
			<li>Consequences are retroactively moralized as deserved pedagogy.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Failure modes:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Ω weaponized:</strong> “You chose, therefore you must absorb all costs.”  </li>
			<li><strong>Χ collapsed:</strong> questioning the learning claim is framed as denial or immaturity.  </li>
			<li><strong>D violated:</strong> exposure is justified by a supposed moral lesson.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural signal:</strong><br>Learning rhetoric functions to legitimize irreversible exposure rather than to protect standing under asymmetry.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>H. Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h3>
			<p>This example <strong>does not claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that people never adapt after loss,</li>
			<li>that narratives of meaning are illegitimate,</li>
			<li>that suffering cannot coincide with insight.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It <strong>does claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that the threshold act itself adds <strong>no epistemic content</strong>,  </li>
			<li>that “learning” here is a <strong>recontextualization effect</strong>, not differentiation,  </li>
			<li>that consequence-legibility under <strong>Θ</strong> should not be confused with maturation.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>I. PMS Validity Check (Application Gate)</h3>
			<p>Any attempt to operationalize this analysis is PMS-valid <strong>only if</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> remains active against retroactive pedagogy,</li>
			<li><strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> is carried rather than denied,</li>
			<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is named without converting exposure into deservedness,</li>
			<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> binds to restraint and repair capacity, not to justificatory myths,</li>
			<li><strong>D (dignity-in-practice)</strong> is preserved despite irreversible outcomes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Absent these conditions, “learning” narratives become instruments of coercion, and any application is <strong>formally invalid as PMS</strong>.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>J. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)</h3>
			<p>From this configuration, a stable structural outcome follows:
			a threshold-crossing act that does not introduce new distinctions
			cannot generate learning in the praxeological sense.
			It generates binding.</p>
			<p>What persists is not insight, but a transformed consequence field:
			reversibility is closed by <strong>Θ</strong>, exposure gradients harden under <strong>Ω</strong>,
			and the system must reorganize itself around a remainder <strong>Λ</strong> that cannot be undone.</p>
			<p>This configuration follows the same breach logic formalized as NRK (§5): enactment occurs 
			under available differentiation without Σ/Ψ carriage, producing consequence-legibility 
			without epistemic expansion.</p>
			<p>“Learning” appears here as a secondary stabilization device.
			Through <strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong>, endurance, adaptation, or loss management
			are narrated as epistemic gain.
			This narration restores coherence, but it does not reopen options.</p>
			<p>The decisive distinction is therefore structural:
			learning expands the option set through new <strong>Δ</strong>;
			this configuration merely reallocates costs under irreversible conditions.</p>
			<p>Treating such acts as pedagogical upgrades risks moralizing exposure
			and converting irreversible loss into justified necessity.
			PMS–EDEN rejects this conversion.
			It insists on carrying consequence-legibility without retroactive legitimation.</p>
